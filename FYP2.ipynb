) .  bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece .  at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary !  this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity .  it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema .  there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan .  oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) .  but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show .  along with the pig , of course !  anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense .  there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine .  he succeeds , but . . . she  knocks the glass over !  i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well !  in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \\\" d'oh ! ! \\\"  other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house .  we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he  realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut  to the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ?  ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work !  boy , do they work !  if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right !  of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \\\" hobbling \\\" !  annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all .  cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it !  nasty .  it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho !  and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen .  she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die !  sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either .  if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable .  but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked .  misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller .  the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem .  wonderful stuff .   ?

\\\"  question springs to mind .  from the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find .  lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement .  all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable .  too bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here .  frankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour .  there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague .  leguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny .  the script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy .  you'd never guess from his performance .  adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better .  sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart .  brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for .  summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way .  but it's also empty , pretentious and boring .  like last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  \",\n          \"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something .  it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up .  it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film .  having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about .  does men live up to its press ?  well , yes it does .  and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office .  for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment .  chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business .  chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder .  howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent .  we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge .  there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her .  the reason ?  both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex .   \\\" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , \\\" he says .  howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan .  they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp .  chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner .  howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate .  flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both .  you can guess which one she falls for .  soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him .  adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ?  in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls .  his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile .  we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart .  his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him .  he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness .  if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind .  politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground .  men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory .  the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe .  the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril .  could it happen in the real world ?  probably not .  taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society .  maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience .  the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive .  the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way .  but does the film work as entertainment ?  its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions .  it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers .  stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her .  likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions .  by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film .  certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed .  but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time .  like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world .  while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs .  there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art .  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"polarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"pos\",\n          \"neg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

) .  bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece .  at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary !  this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity .  it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema .  there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan .  oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) .  but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show .  along with the pig , of course !  anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense .  there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine .  he succeeds , but . . . she  knocks the glass over !  i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well !  in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \\\" d'oh ! ! \\\"  other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house .  we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he  realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut  to the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ?  ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work !  boy , do they work !  if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right !  of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \\\" hobbling \\\" !  annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all .  cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it !  nasty .  it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho !  and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen .  she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die !  sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either .  if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable .  but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked .  misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller .  the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem .  wonderful stuff .   ?

\\\"  question springs to mind .  from the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find .  lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement .  all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable .  too bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here .  frankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour .  there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague .  leguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny .  the script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy .  you'd never guess from his performance .  adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better .  sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart .  brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for .  summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way .  but it's also empty , pretentious and boring .  like last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway .   ?

 well , yes it does .  and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office .  for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment .  chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business .  chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder .  howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent .  we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge .  there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her .  the reason ?  both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex .   \\\" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , \\\" he says .  howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan .  they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp .  chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner .  howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate .  flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both .  you can guess which one she falls for .  soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him .  adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ?  in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls .  his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile .  we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart .  his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him .  he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness .  if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind .  politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground .  men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory .  the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe .  the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril .  could it happen in the real world ?  probably not .  taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society .  maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience .  the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive .  the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way .  but does the film work as entertainment ?  its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions .  it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers .  stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her .  likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions .  by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film .  certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed .  but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time .  like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world .  while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs .  there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art .  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"polarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"pos\",\n          \"neg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rule_based_pred\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"pos\",\n          \"neg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

) .  bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece .  at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary !  this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity .  it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema .  there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan .  oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) .  but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show .  along with the pig , of course !  anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense .  there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine .  he succeeds , but . . . she  knocks the glass over !  i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well !  in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \\\" d'oh ! ! \\\"  other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house .  we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he  realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut  to the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ?  ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work !  boy , do they work !  if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right !  of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \\\" hobbling \\\" !  annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all .  cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it !  nasty .  it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho !  and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen .  she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die !  sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either .  if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable .  but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked .  misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller .  the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem .  wonderful stuff .   ?

\\\"  question springs to mind .  from the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find .  lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement .  all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable .  too bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here .  frankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour .  there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague .  leguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny .  the script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy .  you'd never guess from his performance .  adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better .  sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart .  brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for .  summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way .  but it's also empty , pretentious and boring .  like last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  \",\n          \"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something .  it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up .  it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film .  having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about .  does men live up to its press ?  well , yes it does .  and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office .  for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment .  chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business .  chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder .  howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent .  we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge .  there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her .  the reason ?  both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex .   \\\" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , \\\" he says .  howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan .  they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp .  chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner .  howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate .  flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both .  you can guess which one she falls for .  soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him .  adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ?  in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls .  his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile .  we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart .  his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him .  he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness .  if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind .  politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground .  men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory .  the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe .  the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril .  could it happen in the real world ?  probably not .  taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society .  maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience .  the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive .  the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way .  but does the film work as entertainment ?  its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions .  it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers .  stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her .  likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions .  by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film .  certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed .  but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time .  like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world .  while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs .  there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art .  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"polarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"pos\",\n          \"neg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lexicon_based_pred\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neg\",\n          \"pos\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

bates .  geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this !  sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies .  the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in \\\" absolutely fabulous \\\" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery .  needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs !  but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that \\\" hobbling \\\" scene was no less disturbing !  i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion !  that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching .  stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale .  it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) .  rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's \\\" number one fan \\\" , he soon becomes her prisoner .  both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) .  bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece .  at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary !  this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity .  it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema .  there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan .  oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) .  but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show .  along with the pig , of course !  anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense .  there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine .  he succeeds , but . . . she  knocks the glass over !  i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well !  in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \\\" d'oh ! ! \\\"  other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house .  we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he  realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut  to the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ?  ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work !  boy , do they work !  if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right !  of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \\\" hobbling \\\" !  annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all .  cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it !  nasty .  it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho !  and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen .  she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die !  sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either .  if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable .  but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked .  misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller .  the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem .  wonderful stuff .   ? - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - for more regularly-updated film and tv reviews , check out my site !

, adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth .  rated r .  summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee's abilities .  lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg .  but here , he gets himself into a bind .  his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work .  the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city .  it was the hottest summer on record .  to boot , new york's first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population .  so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city .  the movie's focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters .  we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings .  vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her .  ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more \\\" eccentric , \\\" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend .  tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam's first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again .  a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects .  at the top of the list is ritchie .  vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend .  as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded \\\" so what ? \\\"  question springs to mind .  from the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find .  lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement .  all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable .  too bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here .  frankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour .  there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague .  leguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny .  the script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy .  you'd never guess from his performance .  adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better .  sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart .  brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for .  summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way .  but it's also empty , pretentious and boring .  like last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  \",\n          \"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something .  it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up .  it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film .  having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about .  does men live up to its press ?  well , yes it does .  and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office .  for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment .  chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business .  chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder .  howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent .  we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge .  there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her .  the reason ?  both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex .   \\\" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , \\\" he says .  howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan .  they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp .  chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner .  howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate .  flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both .  you can guess which one she falls for .  soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him .  adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ?  in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls .  his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile .  we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart .  his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him .  he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness .  if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind .  politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground .  men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory .  the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe .  the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril .  could it happen in the real world ?  probably not .  taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society .  maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience .  the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive .  the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way .  but does the film work as entertainment ?  its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions .  it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers .  stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her .  likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions .  by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film .  certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed .  but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time .  like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world .  while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs .  there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art .  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
